# Smoker_Status_MLProject
This project leverages machine learning techniques in Python to predict the probabilities of a person of being a smoker based on bio-signals. It involves an end-to-end data pipeline that incorporates data preprocessing and classification model building. 

You will find: 

Notebooks: 

- Smokers_Preprocessing.ipynb: Including raw code for the data analysis and preprocessing of it, which motivated the latest decisions.
- Smokers_Submission.ipynb: Final code including the transformation of the data and a pipeline of the modeling process.

Data: 
-test.csv: Data used for training the model, found in Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e24
